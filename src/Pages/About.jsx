          Founded in 2024 by Rohanul Islam, My App has come a long way from its
          beginnings in Dhaka. When Rohanul Islam first started out, their
          passion for Softwere Engineer drove them to quit their day job, do
          tons of research, so that My App can offer you the world's most
          advanced product. We now serve customers all over the world, and are
          thrilled that we're able to turn our passion into our own website.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to
          you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to
          contact us.
        </p>
